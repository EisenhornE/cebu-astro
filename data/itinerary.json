      "tip": "Start your day with a visit to the Magellan's Cross, a historical landmark located in the heart of Cebu City. This is where Ferdinand Magellan planted a cross when he arrived in Cebu in 1521. After that, head over to the nearby Basilica del Santo Niño, a 16th-century church that houses the oldest religious relic in the Philippines, the Santo Niño de Cebu. From there, make your way to Fort San Pedro, a military defense structure built by the Spanish in the 17th century. It's located near the port area and offers a great view of the sea. After a morning of sightseeing, take a break for lunch and try some of Cebu's famous lechon (roast pig). One of the most popular places to get it is CnT Lechon. In the afternoon, head to the Taoist Temple, a colorful temple located in the hills of Cebu City. It's a great place to take in some views of the city. End the day by visiting the Cebu Taoist Cemetery, a unique cemetery that features elaborate and colorful mausoleums. "
