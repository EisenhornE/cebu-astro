# Welcome to my Cebu Website

This project is built using Astro jamstack. This project is meant to be a website that tourist can use when they want to travel to Cebu City.

# Tech Stack

- [**Astro**](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/): Main jamstack I used to develop the website.
- Svelte ([**`astro@svelte`**](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/svelte/)): This framework is used to develop reactive components. As this is faster and lighter than ReactJS and with as a recommendation from one of the programmers in my internship. It also supports old browser versions.
- TailwindCSS ([**`astro@tailwind`**](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/tailwind/)): This CSS framework is optional but is a great addition and I recommend using it. You can still augment it with a CSS file but with a single page website, I believe that CSS is a better option to use.
